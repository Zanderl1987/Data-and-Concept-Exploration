# Data-and-Concept-Exploration
They say that the best way to learn something is to apply it. I put together these python projects to do just that. Some of these notebooks are admittedly a little rough and messy. I'll try to clean them up when I have time. These are simply little exploratory projects that I embarked on when I had some free time.
